## Developing with OpenIndiana

**DOC TEAM NOTE:**

The book titled "Introduction to Operating Systems: A Hands-On Approach Using the OpenSolaris Project" may be a good resource for helping to complete this part of the handbook.

Questions to ask:

* How can OI be used as a development platform?
* What programming tools, languages, etc., are available?
* How can OI be used to further the development of OI itself?


## Software Development Testing

**DOC TEAM NOTE:**

Need to add some guidance about how to add a test repo to test specific packages, etc.
