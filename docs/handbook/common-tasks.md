## Basic UNIX commands

In addition to native command line system administration tools, OpenIndiana also includes the GNU core utilities suite.
When working with basic UNIX commands, most likely you will be using the GNU core utilities.
For learning to navigate the OpenIndiana command line environment, Linux command line books are very helpful.

One of the best books currently available is [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) by William Shotts.
If you want to quickly become a command line guru, this is the book to read.
Best of all, it was released under a Creative Commons license and can be downloaded for free.
Print versions are also available.
