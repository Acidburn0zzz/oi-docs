# About OpenIndiana Docs (Demo 2.0)


<!-- NOTE: --> <i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **This website is NOT an official OpenIndiana site**
<div class="well">
The purpose of this technology demonstration website is to examine the Mkdocs framework and the Markdown text markup language to help determine whether these technologies suite the needs of the OpenIndiana project.
</div>

This website and its content uses a number of different technologies:

* Page content written in the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text markup language.
* Text markup transformed to HTML &#xf13b; using the [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation framework/static site generator.
* Website styled using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS &#xf13c; framework (more specifically the [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) Spacelab theme).
* Source code hosted in a [GitHub](https://github.com/makruger/website-2.0) &#xf09b; repository.
* Website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
