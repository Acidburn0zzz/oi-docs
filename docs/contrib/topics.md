# Contributor Topics

The goal of this page is to provide a TODO list of things which need to be documented.
Topics will be organized first by page and then by topic.

## About OpenIndiana

Have a look at the following resources for ideas and inspiration for writing new content:

* [OpenSolaris FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20091001032442/http://www.opensolaris.com/learn/faq/)
* [OpenSolaris Newbie FAQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20090909080957/http://opensolaris.org/os/community/documentation/newbie_faq/)

TODO:

* Write a table where _included_ features of OpenIndiana are compared to _licensed_ features found in commercial software.
    * For example: Qemu-KVM | HyperV, Esxi, etc. , Zones | Docker, etc.
* Need to look at the legal aspects of mentioning trademarked names within documentation (to help keep openindiana out of trouble).
* Add a blurb about switching to hipster. See [link](http://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/Hipster#Hipster-switching)
* Link in download URL's for ISO's, etc.: See [release notes](http://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/2016.04+Release+notes)
* Write a table providing a matrix comparing commands between BSD/Linux/OpenIndiana.
    * This could also be something for the handbook.
    * Place it wherever it looks best.
* See [this page](https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/ITDOC/Major+difference+between+Linux+and+Solaris)
* Also can look at old OpenSolaris website for ideas, suggestions, etc.


## Handbook - Getting Started

Import first section of Wiki page: <http://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/Using+OpenIndiana+-+Technical+FAQ>

Have a look at the following resources for ideas and inspiration for writing new content:

* [Linux Versus OpenSolaris](https://web.archive.org/web/20090824053055/http://opensolaris.org/os/project/czosug/events_archive/czosug_muni_20090228_OpenSolaris_and_Linux_Basic_Comparison.pdf)

* System partitioning, Gparted, etc.
* Device Driver utility - (also how to manually install missing drivers - and where to find them if they are available)
* How to disable drivers at boot time
* Network install drivers: `pkgrecv -s http://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster-2015 -d bash.p5a -a bash && sudo pkg install -nv  -g bash.p5a bash`
* Local install drivers: `pkg install -g name.p5a fmri`


### Write some comparison tables

* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and other illumos distros.
* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and other BSD distros (PCBSD in relation to freebsd, etc.)
* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and Linux, etc. (Linux kernel and GNU userland, illumos kernel and GNU userland, etc.)
    * For an example, see: [this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20090904201802/http://wikis.sun.com/display/SolarisDeveloper/Migrating+from+Linux+to+Solaris+or+OpenSolaris)
* Command comparison tables â€“ e.g. if such and such command does something on Linux, Windows, BSD, etc., use such and such command to do same thing on OI.
    * For some inspiration, see the tables found on the SmartOS Wiki.
    * Oracle might have some inspiration as well - (just don't copy it verbatim)


## Handbook - Common Tasks

### CUPS Printing

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) has been selected as the default print service, replacing the LP print service, in OpenSolaris 2010.03.
CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment.
A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer.
To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services.

Doc team Note: The guidance provided by the OSOL printing administration book is largely obsolete (but parts may still be valid) as CUPS replaced the old Solaris printing subsystem found in OpenSolaris 2009.06.
However, OpenIndiana has 2 print subsystems (CUPS and LP).
They are managed by the `print-service` command, which allows you to designate the active print subsystem.
See the print-services (1M) man page for more information.
In contrast, Oracle dropped lp completely in the Solaris 11.0 release.

### Installing OI onto an ISCSI exposed SCSI target

A good tutorial might be to write about installing OpenIndiana Hipster on an ISCSI target.

```bash
[14:50:02] <alp> does someone have some links on "installing OI on ISCSI" ?
[14:57:40] <tsoome> alp get to illumos wiki, open projects loader -> ideas, from there you get link for jeffpc iscsi experiment
[14:57:46] <tsoome> I did use it to play with ipxe+iscsi+loader
```

Also can look at Oracle docs for reference: [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29008/iscsi-1.html](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29008/iscsi-1.html)


## OpenSolaris Redistributable Books


* Review the OpenSolaris redistributable books.
* Determine the relevancy of each book in comparison to the current development state of OpenIndiana Hipster.
* Compose lists of errata as required.
