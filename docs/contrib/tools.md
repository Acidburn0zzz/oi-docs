# Documentation Team Tools


The OpenIndiana Docs website uses 2 principal technologies:

* The MkDocs content authoring framework.
* The Markdown text markup language.

Both technologies leverage the Python programming language.


## What is MkDocs?

MkDocs is a modern, flexible, and feature rich content authoring framework and static website generator.
The python based MkDocs framework publishes content as HTML5.
In conjunction with the MkDocs-Pandoc module, content may also be published in the PDF and EPUB formats.

Unlike a CMS system where you are restricted to the confines of an integral editor, the OpenIndiana Docs website has no such restriction.
Here content is authored using a simple text based markup.
Because you are working with plain text files, content may be authored using Atom, EMACS, Gedit, Nano, VIM, or any other text editor.
The choice is yours; Use your favorite text editor.


## MkDocs System Characteristics

* Easy to use Markdown syntax.
* Produces professional quality output.
* Extensible - accepts plugins.


## Why a Text Markup Based Docs Framework?

The primary advantage of using a text markup language is readability and flexibility.
The raw code for your authored content is simple plain text.
No need work with special tools such as WYSIWYG XML editors, etc.

## The OpenIndiana Docs GitHub Repository


As the OpenIndiana Docs website is still a proof of concept technology demonstration, its Github repository remains under the private control of the original author.
If the concept is approved for inclusion under OpenIndiana GitHub organizational umbrella, then it will have an official repository.

Meanwhile, you can find the OpenIndiana Docs repository here: [https://github.com/makruger/website](https://github.com/makruger/website)

The repository consists of 2 branches:

* master
* gh-pages

Development occurs in the master branch and the site is published to the gh-pages branch, where the content becomes available via GitHub Pages.

## Docs Site Theming and Design


The OpenIndiana Docs website is built using the MkDocs static site generator framework.
CSS styling is managed through the use of a bootstrap derived CSS theming template.
Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework which makes it easier to develop static websites using predefined HTML elements.
This site uses the [bootwatch spacelab](https://bootswatch.com/spacelab/) theme.
