## Getting started with markdown

### Headers

Headers in markdown (much like HTML) come in various sizes.

```markdown
# First level header

## Second level headers

### Tirtiary level header
```

In this simple example you can see some headers have less hashes then others.
The more hashes added, the smaller the header will be, for example.

# First level header

## Second level header

## Tirtiary level header
