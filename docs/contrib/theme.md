== Docs Site Theming and Design

=== Introduction

The OpenIndiana Docs website is built using the Awestruct static site generator framework.
CSS styling is managed through the use of a bootstrap derived CSS theming template.
Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework which makes it easier to develop static websites using predefined HTML elements.
This site uses the https://bootswatch.com/spacelab/[bootwatch spacelab] theme.
