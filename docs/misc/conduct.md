# OpenIndiana Code of Conduct

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the OpenIndiana community.
It applies to all "collaborative space", which is defined as community communications channels (such as mailing lists, IRC, submitted patches, commit comments, etc.).


## Core principles and expectations:

* We are respectful and appreciative towards peoples work, time, and effort.
* We are tolerant of the right to have opposing views.
* We recognize our public actions determine the public perception of the project.
* Participants must ensure their language and actions are free from personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.


## What will not be tolerated:

* Open hostility, and or abusive language.
* Repeated complaining (rehashing) of closed (decided) issues.
* Participants who disrupt the collaborative space, or participate in a pattern of behavior which could be considered harassment.
* Filibustering - (replying with negative or opposing viewpoints to every post in a mailing list thread).


## Reporting violations:

* Violations of the CoC should only be reported to the maintainers via direct messages on IRC, twitter, or via E-mail and will be handled confidentially.
    * Neither reporters nor reported persons will, or should be, made public.
