# About OpenIndiana Docs (Demo 2.0)


<!-- NOTE: --> <i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> **This website is NOT an official OpenIndiana site**
<div class="well">
The purpose of this technology demonstration website is to examine the Mkdocs framework (and its Markdown text markup language) to determine whether these technologies suit the needs of the OpenIndiana project.
</div>

This website and its content uses a number of different technologies:

* Page content written in the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text markup language.
* Text markup transformed to HTML using the [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation framework/static site generator.
* Website styled using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework (more specifically the [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) Spacelab theme).
* Source code hosted in a [GitHub](https://github.com/makruger/website-2.0) repository.
* Website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)


## History of OpenIndiana Docs

The current documentation revitalization effort began in late 2015.
For some time the project recognized it needed to do a better job of organizing and presenting end user documentation.
Just as important, it also recognized how documentation needed to more accurately follow the development state of OpenIndiana Hipster.

The docs team began by looking at:

* The current state of the OpenIndiana project's documentation.
* The methods and toolkits used to create past and present documentation.
* How other projects where approaching their systems documentation efforts.

## Documentation revitalization effort goals

As a result of the aforementioned exercises, the team established the following goals:

* Increase participation and lower the bar of entry by simplifying the documentation process.
* Provide well organized, technically accurate information in an aesthetically pleasing way.
* Treat docs like code (for example: using version control, continuous integration, etc.)
* Migrate all existing and future documentation to a simple text based markup.
* Deploy documentation via a static website generator.
* Employ a dynamic _mobile friendly_ CSS framework.

To this end, the team looked at several documentation oriented static site generators and selected MkDocs for its simplicity, ease of use, and professional quality output.
