## History of OpenIndiana Docs

The current documentation revitalization effort began in late 2015.
For some time the project recognized it needed to do a better job of organizing and presenting end user documentation.
Just as important, it also recognized how documentation needed to more accurately follow the development state of OpenIndiana Hipster.

The docs team began by looking at:

* The current state of the OpenIndiana project's documentation.
* The methods and toolkits used to create past and present documentation.
* How other projects where approaching their systems documentation efforts.

## Documentation revitalization effort goals

As a result of the aforementioned exercises, the team established the following goals:

* Increase participation and lower the bar of entry by simplifying the documentation process.
* Provide well organized, technically accurate information in an aesthetically pleasing way.
* Treat docs like code (for example: using version control, continuous integration, etc.)
* Migrate all existing and future documentation to a simple text based markup.
* Deploy documentation via a static website generator.
* Employ a dynamic _mobile friendly_ CSS framework.

To this end, the team looked at several documentation oriented static site generators and selected MkDocs for its simplicity, ease of use, and professional quality output.

## Contributing to OI-DOCS

First and foremost, we understand using development tools and techniques to write end user documentation is not for everyone.
For this reason, we're happy to accept your contribution in any format you wish to provide.

We'll happy accept contributions in plain text, .doc, .docx, .odt, html, xml, latex, pdf, etc.

If you think it can be helpful to the greater OpenIndiana community, we'll be happy to review it for incorporation into the docs collection.
