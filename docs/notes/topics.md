# Topics to write about

The goal of this page is to provide a TODO list of things which need to be documented.
Topics will be organized first by page and then by topic.

The second level headers will indicate the page.
Third level headers will indicate topics, etc.

It might be easier to first populate this page with 3rd level subject headers and then later come back and assign pages.

#### Write some comparison tables

* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and other illumos distros.
* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and other BSD distros (PCBSD in relation to freebsd, etc.)
* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and Linux, etc. (Linux kernel and GNU userland, illumos kernel and GNU userland, etc.)
    * See: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090904201802/http://wikis.sun.com/display/SolarisDeveloper/Migrating+from+Linux+to+Solaris+or+OpenSolaris](https://web.archive.org/web/20090904201802/http://wikis.sun.com/display/SolarisDeveloper/Migrating+from+Linux+to+Solaris+or+OpenSolaris)
* Command comparison tables â€“ e.g. if such and such command does something on Linux, Windows, BSD, etc., use such and such command to do same thing on OI.
    * For some inspiration, see the tables found on the SmartOS Wiki.
    * Oracle might have some inspiration as well - (just don't copy it verbatim)


## Handbook - Common Tasks

### CUPS Printing

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) has been selected as the default print service, replacing the LP print service, in OpenSolaris 2010.03.
CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment.
A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer.
To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services.

Doc team Note: The guidance provided by the OSOL printing administration book is largely obsolete (but parts may still be valid) as CUPS replaced the old Solaris printing subsystem found in OpenSolaris 2009.06.
However, OpenIndiana has 2 print subsystems (CUPS and LP).
They are managed by the `print-service` command, which allows you to designate the active print subsystem.
See the print-services (1M) man page for more information.
In contrast, Oracle dropped lp completely in the Solaris 11.0 release.

#### ABI support

* Write about the change from Sun Studio to GCC its implications for ABI from previous Solaris releases/OpenSolaris, etc.
    * For more details, see: [http://openindiana.org/pipermail/oi-dev/2014-December/003496.html](http://openindiana.org/pipermail/oi-dev/2014-December/003496.html)
    * We might also want to talk about what other effects (if any) have/will result from the move to OI-Userland


#### Write about Virtualization

* add a page about running OI as a virtual guest in Virtualbox, VMware, KVM, talk about which provides the best hardware support, guest tools compatibility, other caveats, etc.

#### Installing OI onto an ISCSI exposed SCSI target

A good tutorial might be to write about installing OpenIndiana Hipster on an ISCSI target.

```bash
[14:50:02] <alp> does someone have some links on "installing OI on ISCSI" ?
[14:57:40] <tsoome> alp get to illumos wiki, open projects loader -> ideas, from there you get link for jeffpc iscsi experiment
[14:57:46] <tsoome> I did use it to play with ipxe+iscsi+loader
```

Also can look at Oracle docs for reference: [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29008/iscsi-1.html](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29008/iscsi-1.html)
