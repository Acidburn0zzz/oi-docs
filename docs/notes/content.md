# OpenIndiana Content Creation

This pages is a whiteboard for ideas and inspirations to get out there and write some content.
Contributing to the OpenIndiana project by helping with content creation doesn't mean you need to get involved in anything major.
Start small and only later consider taking on something larger.

## Why Fresh Website Content is so Important

Good docs and a steady stream of fresh website content inspires confidence in the project.
These things also help show the project is alive and thriving.
Here are a couple of end user quotes which serve as a reminder.


### A User Comment Posted to the OI Wiki in 2011

>Documentation such as a manual is essential in not just learning from, it tells everyone where the product is in the scheme of things.
>Referring to Oracle for documentation relating to OI just makes one have less confidence with OI itself.
>Look at the FreeBSD site documentation levels are really good and gives people confidence to try FreeBSD and its derivatives.

### A User Comment Posted to the FreeBSD Forum in 2013

>FreeBSD has been around almost as long as Unix itself existed (not entirely true, but you get the idea) and same can be said for Solaris as it was.
>Yet the OpenSolaris group basically still has to prove themselves.
>For all I know (from a commercial point of view) they could be gone next month.
>That makes it a liability, especially in comparison to Sun being out of the picture and the love/hate relationship with Oracle.


#### Suggestions For How to Approach Content Creation for Larger Works

While it's true there are some major projects that need love, helping out with one doesn't necessarily mean you have to write the entire thing yourself.
* Pick a doc and tackle a single section.
* Pick a doc and add in some TODO's where they are obviously needed.
* Add new sectional placeholders where they are needed.

#### Larger Works

* FAQ
* User Handbook
* Developer Handbook
* Updating the OpenSolaris books

#### Smaller Works

* Writing a news story
* Writing a blog post
* Writing a tutorial
* Writing an episode of Hipster news
* Documenting the documentation process
