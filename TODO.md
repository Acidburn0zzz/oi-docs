- [ ] Setup [travis](travis-ci.org) (probably via PR)
- [X] Fix typos
- [X ] Modify MD007 to allow 4 spaces for an unordered list.
- [X] Replace docs\index.md so we have a new website front page
- [X] Work on contributors page so people know how to contribute by forking our work, installing and using mkdocs, markdown, manually running lint locally, etc.
- [ ] Start looking at the handbook and how to best move forward making it useful, reorganizing sections, pulling in content from the OI wiki, etc.
