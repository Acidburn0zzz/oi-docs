            "text": "About OpenIndiana\n\n\nWhat is OpenIndiana?\n\n\nThe OpenIndiana project is the open source community which develops, maintains, and supports the \nOpenIndiana\n distribution, an \nIllumos\n based Unix-like operating system derived from OpenSolaris.\nThe purpose of the OpenIndiana Project is to ensure the continued availability of an openly developed distribution based on OpenSolaris.\nThe OpenIndiana project is also a continuation of the collaborative effort and community spirit of the \nOpenSolaris project\n.\n\n\nFor a comprehensive history of the OpenSolaris project, see Jim Grisanzio's \nOpenSolaris timeline\n.\n\n\nWhy is it called OpenIndiana?\n\n\nOpenIndiana obtains its name from Project Indiana, an open source effort by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) to produce OpenSolaris, a community developed Unix-like distribution based on Sun Solaris.\nProject Indiana was led by Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian Linux Distribution.\n\n\nHow are OpenIndiana and Illumos related?\n\n\nThe \nIllumos project\n is the open source community which develops, maintains, and supports \nillumos-gate\n, the core software used by the OpenIndiana distribution.\nSimilar to a BSD \nsrc\n tree, illumos-gate includes the illumos kernel, along with many of the device drivers, core libraries, and system utilities.\n\n\nTo form a complete distribution, the OpenIndiana project combines illumos-gate with \noi-userland\n, and with other free and open-source software.\nThis melding of software from many different open-source projects is similar to how Linux distributions use the Linux kernel along with software from the GNU and various other open source projects.\n\n\nHow does OpenIndiana differ from OpenSolaris?\n\n\nSome of the differences between OpenIndiana and OpenSolaris can be characterized as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSun's OS/NET consolidation (closed by Oracle) has been replaced with \nillumos-gate\n.\n\n\nMany of the original OpenSolaris software consolidations have been reorganized into a single oi-userland consolidation.\n\n\nOracle's Sun Studio has been replaced with the open source GNU GCC compiler.\n\n\nXVM (XEN) has been replaced with the illumos-kvm port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster's transition from Sun Studio to GCC has resulted in a discontinuance of ABI (binary) compatibility with previous releases of OpenIndiana, Oracle Solaris, and OpenSolaris.\nApplications coded in the \nC\n language should continue to work normally.\nTherefore, this change only affects applications written in the \nC++\n language.\n\n\n\nHow does OpenIndiana compare to BSD or Linux?\n\n\nAll of these operating systems follow the Unix paradigm and contain tools and commands which bear a similar resemblance, although specific feature sets and command usage may be dissimilar.\nIf you are coming to OpenIndiana from either BSD or Linux, you will quickly learn these differences.\nIn no time at all, you'll feel right at home working with OpenIndiana's tools and commands.\n\n\nWhat features does OpenIndiana have?\n\n\nOpenIndiana contains the following enterprise class features and more:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZFS\n\n\nZFS File System and Volume Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTrace\n\n\nDynamic Tracing Framework - (System Introspection)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossbow\n\n\nNetwork Virtualization and Resource Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMF\n\n\nService Management Facility\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFMA\n\n\nFault Management Architecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMSTAR\n\n\nCommon Multiprotocol SCSI TARget - (ISCSI Target Framework)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKVM\n\n\nKernel Virtual Machine - (Operating System Virtualization)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZones\n\n\nOS Level Virtualized Application Containers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime-Slider\n\n\nAutomated ZFS Snapshots and Rollbacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRBAC\n\n\nRole-Based Access Control\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIPMP\n\n\nIP Network Multipathing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLMP\n\n\nData Link Multipathing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the OpenIndiana release schedule?\n\n\nApproximately every six months, the OpenIndiana project releases a snapshot of the Hipster rolling release branch.\nIdeally suited for both workstations and servers, simply choose the installer type which best serves your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkstation\n\n\nServer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive installer (Gnome desktop)\n\n\nText installer (command line console)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legacy oi-dev-151x branch is no longer maintained.\n\n\nWhile upgrades to Hipster are possible, the most trouble free method is to perform a clean install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nHipster is a rapid development branch where software versions are frequently updated.\nWhile every package is tested to ensure stability, caution is nevertheless warranted when deploying Hipster into mission critical production environments.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the recommended hardware specifications?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU\n\n\nDisk Space\n\n\nMemory (RAM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64 Bit\n\n\n20GB (or more)\n\n\n2GB (or more)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the best performance (and to reduce the possibility of disk swapping), allocate 4GB RAM or more.\n\n\nFor desktops, ensure total system memory (RAM + swap) are at least 4GB or greater.\n\n\nThe default size of the OpenIndiana swap file is 50% of installed memory.\n\n\nMinimum and maximum default swap allocations are 512MB and 32GB respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes OpenIndiana support internationalization and localization?\n\n\nYes, when installing OpenIndiana, you may choose from 47 different keyboard layouts and 22 different languages.\n\n\nDoes OpenIndiana provide security and bug fixes?\n\n\nYes, absolutely.\nFor the actively maintained Hipster rolling release, the OpenIndiana project seeks to ensure all known flaws are quickly mitigated.\nFor this effort to succeed, we ask our user base to diligently bring security and bugfix concerns to our attention by submitting a ticket with the \nOpenIndiana Bug Tracker\n.\n\n\nWhere can I download OpenIndiana Hipster?\n\n\nPrimary download mirror (London, England):\n\n\n\n\nISO's and USB Images\n\n\nTorrents\n\n\n\n\nAlternate mirrors (Asia, Europe, and North America)\n\n\n\n\nhttps://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/Mirrors\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to purchase a ready made DVD or USB drive there is also \nOSDISC.COM\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nAt this time, creating a bootable flash drive requires the use of a header file.\n\n\n\n\nThere are 2 unique USB header files (1G and 2G).\n\n\nPlease ensure you have selected the correct file.\n\n\nThe 1G.header is only suitable for use with the text installer (Command line console).\n\n\nThe 2G.header is only suitable for use with the live installer (Gnome desktop).\n\n\nThe files are \nNOT\n interchangeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure to use the correct USB header file can result in the USB drive either failing to boot, or only partially booting (and falling back to systems maintenance mode with KSH93 errors).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster does not yet support USB 3.0.\n\n\n\n\nWhen attaching backward compatible USB 3.0 devices to your system, please ensure they are \nNOT\n attached to a USB 3.0 port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information about how to create a bootable OpenIndiana flash drive, consult the \nOpenIndiana Handbook\n.\n\n\nWhat package manager does OpenIndiana use?\n\n\nOpenIndiana uses the network based \nImage Packaging System (IPS)\n.\nFor those coming to OpenIndiana from BSD or Linux, the IPS package manager will be an easy transition.\nYou may also continue to use the legacy \npkgadd/pkgrm\n commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nThe OpenIndiana distribution provides a basic set of packages, along with some extras.\nThere are also 3rd party repositories which provide additional packages.\nIf you wish to contribute by helping to expand package availability, please read further down about how to get involved with the OpenIndiana project.\n\n\n\nThe following IPS repositories are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepository Name\n\n\nRepository URL\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopenindiana.org\n\n\nhttps://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster\n\n\nHipster primary package

OpenIndiana Hipster.\n\n\nWhat books are available to help with learning OpenIndiana?\n\n\nThere are several resources which will assist you with learning to use OpenIndiana.\nWhile somewhat dated now, these resources are largely still relevant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro OpenSolaris\n\n\n\n\nA gentle and well written introduction to OpenSolaris. It weighs in at 250 pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenSolaris Bible\n\n\n\n\nA much larger and more comprehensive reference book of nearly 1000 Pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe illumos bookshelf\n\n\n\n\nUpdated for illumos, the illumos bookshelf consists of several original OpenSolaris advanced administration and development titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenSolaris 2009.06 Docs\n\n\n\n\nOriginally released by the OpenSolaris project, this collection consists of over 40 titles ranging from development to systems administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nAn effort currently exists within the OpenIndiana community to review these books and provide errata.\nA longer term goal is to use the errata to revise and condense these titles into a significantly smaller collection which more closely follows the current development state of OpenIndiana Hipster.\n\n\nThe documentation team is also working to produce an updated OpenIndiana handbook as well as task based tutorials.\nIf you wish to participate in this effort, please indicate your interest via the IRC channels or the mailing lists.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I get involved with the OpenIndiana Project?\n\n\nAs a community supported open source software project, the success and future of OpenIndiana depends entirely on you.\nWhile the most important thing is to download and begin using OpenIndiana, there are many different ways to contribute.\nTell your friends and coworkers about OpenIndiana as well, and don't forget to report all issues to our bug tracker.\n\n\nBelow is a list of OpenIndiana community resources you may find helpful:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\n\n\nURL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Support IRC channel\n\n\n#openindiana on irc.freenode.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment IRC channel\n\n\n#oi-dev on irc.freenode.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation IRC channel\n\n\n#oi-documentation on irc.freenode.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Mailing Lists\n\n\nhttps://openindiana.org/mailman\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Wiki\n\n\nhttps://wiki.openindiana.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Bug Tracker\n\n\nhttp://www.illumos.org/projects/openindiana/issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are just some of the many ways you may contribute:\n\n\n\n\nArtwork\n\n\nDevelopment\n\n\nDocumentation - Handbook, Tutorials, News articles, etc.\n\n\nEvangelism - blogging about OpenIndiana, attending conferences, etc.\n\n\nPackaging - oi-userland, 3rd party packaging (SFE, etc.)\n\n\nRelease engineering\n\n\nTranslation\n\n\nUtilities maintenance\n\n\nWebsite Maintenance\n\n\n\n\nJust ask on the IRC channels or mailing lists about how you may contribute.\n\n\nFor additional details, including links to our GitHub source repositories, please see: \nhttps://www.openindiana.org/community/getting-involved\n\n\nDoes OpenIndiana provide a SPARC release?\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster is not currently available for the SPARC platform.\n\n\nIn regards to the creation of a SPARC port of OpenIndiana Hipster, there have been periodic discussions on the \nOpenIndiana mailing lists\n.\nIf you would like to see SPARC become a supported platform, please help us by joining the \nOpenIndiana community\n.\n\n\nHistorical SPARC releases\n\n\nIn 2009, the OpenSolaris project released an \nOpenSolaris text install ISO\n, and much more recently, there was work done by Adam Glasgall who produced an \nunofficial SPARC text install ISO\n based on oi-dev-151-a8.\n\n\nillumos distributions with SPARC releases\n\n\nThe following illumos based distributions are known to support the SPARC platform:\n\n\n\n\nDilos\n\n\nOpenSCXE\n\n\nTribblix\n\n\n\n\nCommercial distributions with SPARC releases\n\n\nFor production use on modern SPARC hardware, there is also commercial \nOracle Solaris\n\n\nWhat are the licensing terms for OpenIndiana?\n\n\nOpenIndiana is composed of software from multiple different sources, each with its own licensing terms.\n\n\nHere is a list of the most commonly used licenses:\n\n\n\n\nCommon Development and Distribution License (CDDL-1.0)\n\n\nPUBLIC DOCUMENTATION LICENSE (PDL), Version 1.01\n\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\n\nThe BSD 2-Clause License\n\n\nGNU licenses",

OpenSolaris 2009.06 Docs   Originally released by the OpenSolaris project, this collection consists of over 40 titles ranging from development to systems administration.        NOTE:   An effort currently exists within the OpenIndiana community to review these books and provide errata.\nA longer term goal is to use the errata to revise and condense these titles into a significantly smaller collection which more closely follows the current development state of OpenIndiana Hipster.  The documentation team is also working to produce an updated OpenIndiana handbook as well as task based tutorials.\nIf you wish to participate in this effort, please indicate your interest via the IRC channels or the mailing lists.",

(The illumos port of Linux KVM)\n\n\n\n\nVirtual machines provide a PC emulation layer in which you install OpenIndiana just as you would on physical 'bare metal' hardware.\n\n\nVagrant\n\n\nVagrant provides an excellent way to explore OpenIndiana as it fully automates the process of bringing a virtual machine online.\nOpenIndiana comes with an official \nVagrant\n box, which can be used for exploring OpenIndiana before installing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nAt this time, the OpenIndiana Vagrant box is only available in the form of a text based console.\nAdditionally, Virtualbox is the only currently supported Vagrant provider.\nIn the future the OpenIndiana project hopes to provide additional Vagrant box options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nVagrant is officially available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install the latest version of Vagrant for your platform from the \nofficial download page\n.\n\n\nDownload and install the latest version of Virtualbox for your platform from the \nofficial download page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nOlder versions of Vagrant (as packaged by many LTS Linux distributions), may not support downloading the Vagrant box instance.\nTo work around this limitation, be sure to remove any previously installed instances of Vagrant and obtain the latest Vagrant software directly from the Vagrant website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command to download and boot the OpenIndiana vagrant box:\n\n\n\n\nmkdir ~/openindiana_test\ncd ~/openindiana_test\nvagrant init openindiana/hipster\nvagrant up --provider virtualbox\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a file titled \nVagrantfile\n under the ~/openindiana_test directory.\nThe Vagrant box will also be booted.\n\n\n\n\nOnce, the Vagrant box virtual machine is online, connect to it using the following command:\n\n\n\n\nvagrant ssh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo destroy the OpenIndiana Vagrant instance, issue the following command:\n\n\n\n\nvagrant destroy\n\n\n\n\nPreparation for installing OpenIndiana\n\n\nPrior to installing OpenIndiana:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure your system meets the recommended hardware requirements.\n\n\nEnsure to consult the HCL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana on unsupported hardware may cause excessive CPU usage, instability, or other problems.\n\n\nPlease be sure to consult the hardware compatibility list (HCL):\n\n\n\n\nIllumos HLC\n\n\nOpenIndiana HCL - components\n\n\nOpenIndiana HCL - systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOC TEAM NOTE:\n\n\n\n\nGigabyte motherboards with Intel socket 775 and ICH10 chipset don't work well with OI.\n\n\nKernel CPU usage can range from 40-80% cpu @ idle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeems to work OK on Intel brand desktop motherboards though.\n\n\nWorks well with HP Zxxx class workstation hardware.\n\n\n\n\nBacking up data\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nBefore attempting to install OpenIndiana, first ensure you backup any important data.\nDo not save the data on another partition or on another disk within the same system.\nInstead save the data to an external device such as a USB hard drive, or external system (network backup service, or a networked system).\nAlways verify your backed up data.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeciding where to install OpenIndiana\n\n\nBy default the OpenIndiana installer creates an EFI partition using a GPT partition table.\nUsing this option, OpenIndiana will use the entire disk.\nNo other operating system can share the same disk.\n\n\nOptionally you may use a legacy MBR partition.\nMBR partitions will allow you to create multiple partitions.\nMBR will also support dual booting another operating system.\n\n\nAnother option is to install to a virtual machine.\n\n\nGathering network information\n\n\nIf you network uses a DHCP server, OpenIndiana can be configured to automatically obtain it's network information.\nIf a DHCP server is not available, then you will need to manually configure your network settings.\n\n\nObtain the following information:\n\n\n\n\nIP address\n\n\nSubnet mask\n\n\nGateway\n\n\nNetwork domain name\n\n\nNetwork DNS servers\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the software\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary download mirror (London, England):\n\n\n\n\nISO's and USB Images\n\n\nTorrents\n\n\n\n\nAlternate mirrors (Asia, Europe, and North America)\n\n\n\n\nhttps://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/Mirrors\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to purchase a ready made DVD or USB drive there is also \nOSDISC.COM\n.\n\n\nDownload Example:\n\n\nwget \nhttp://dlc.openindiana.org/isos/hipster/OI-hipster-gui-20160421.iso\n\nwget \nhttp://dlc.openindiana.org/isos/hipster/OI-hipster-gui-20160421.iso.sha256sum\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking the MD5/SHA\n\n\nChecksum Verification Example:\n\n\nsha256sum --check OI-hipster-gui-20160421.iso.sha256sum\nOI-hipster-gui-20160421.iso: OK\n\n\n\n\nCreating a bootable OpenIndiana DVD\n\n\nBSD/illumos/Solaris\n\n\nUNIX Console\n \n\n\ncdrecord dev=device imagefile.iso\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\ncdrecord dev=/dev/rdsk/c4t1d0p0 OI-hipster-gui-20160421.iso\n\n\n/usr/bin/cdrecord.bin: No write mode specified.\n/usr/bin/cdrecord.bin: Assuming -sao mode.\n/usr/bin/cdrecord.bin: If your drive does not accept -sao, try -tao.\n/usr/bin/cdrecord.bin: Future versions of cdrecord may have different drive dependent defaults.\nCdrecord-ProDVD-ProBD-Clone 3.00 (i386-pc-solaris2.11) Copyright (C) 1995-2010 J\ufffdrg Schilling\nscsidev: '/dev/rdsk/c4t1d0p0'\ndevname: '/dev/rdsk/c4t1d0p0'\nscsibus: -2 target: -2 lun: -2\nWarning: Using USCSI interface.\nUsing libscg version 'schily-0.9'.\nDevice type    : Removable CD-ROM\nVersion        : 0\nResponse Format: 2\nCapabilities   :\nVendor_info    : 'HL-DT-ST'\nIdentifikation : 'DVDRAM GSA-U20N '\nRevision       : 'HX12'\nDevice seems to be: Generic mmc2 DVD-R/DVD-RW/DVD-RAM.\nUsing generic SCSI-3/mmc-2 DVD-R/DVD-RW/DVD-RAM driver (mmc_dvd).\nDriver flags   : NO-CD DVD MMC-3 SWABAUDIO BURNFREE\nSupported modes: PACKET SAO LAYER_JUMP\nStarting to write CD/DVD/BD at speed 2 in real SAO mode for single session.\nLast chance to quit, starting real write    0 seconds.

English.\n\n\nThe live media desktop\n\n\n\n\nThe Live Media DVD and USB installers provide a graphical live environment where you can explore OpenIndiana and test the compatibility of your hardware.\nWhen using Live Media, no changes are made to your system unless you explicitly choose to install OpenIndiana or alter the configuration of your disk using the Gparted Partition Editor.\n\n\nThe following options are available to you from the Live Media Desktop:\n\n\n\n\nInstall OpenIndiana using the Text Installer\n\n\nInstall OpenIndiana (graphical installer)\n\n\nDevice Driver Utility\n\n\nGparted Partition Editor\n\n\n\n\nUsing the device driver utility\n\n\nAvailable from the LiveDVD, the \nDevice Driver Utility\n may be used to scan your hardware for compatability.\nThe utility generates a list of hardware devices along with the cooresponding driver in use for each device.\nThe utility will also show you devices for which there is no driver loaded.\nThe device driver utility allows you to check whether your hardware requires additional drivers.\n\n\nUsing the Gparted Partition Editor\n\n\nThe Gparted partition editor allows you to add, remove, or resize partitions in preparation for installing OpenIndiana.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nEditing partition tables is a potentially destructive process.\nWhile you are unlikely to physically damage the disk, there is a risk of losing data.\nBefore using the partition editor, please be sure to back up your data to a remote system or device.\n\n\n\n\n\nLive media authentication\n\n\nThe user login for the live media session is \njack\n along with the password \njack\n.\nFor administrative or elevated access, prepend your commands with \nsudo\n.\n\n\nYou may

section:\n\n\n\n\nInstallation walkthrough: \nweb link\n\n\nInstallation videos: \nweb link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nBefore you install OpenIndiana on a system that is running the Linux OS, save a copy of the menu.lst file.\nThe contents of the GRUB menu.lst file dictate what is displayed in the GRUB menu when you boot the system.\nYou will need to update the GRUB menu after the installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nPlease take note the following important considerations:\n\n\n\n\nThe installation overwrites the whole disk layout if one of the following is true:\n\n\nThe disk table cannot be read.\n\n\nThe disk was not previously partitioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an existing Solaris fdisk partition is on a multiboot system, and the user makes no modifications to the existing partitions, the installation overwrites the Solaris fdisk partition only.\nOther existing partitions are not changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana from live media\n\n\nTo install OpenIndiana from Live Media, you have two options.\n\n\n\n\nInstall OpenIndiana using the Text Installer\n\n\nInstall OpenIndiana (graphical installer)\n\n\n\n\nEach of these options is represented by a desktop icon.\nSelect the appropriate installer option by clicking the corresponding desktop installer icon.\n\n\nInstall OpenIndiana (graphical installer)\n\n\nBegin installing OpenIndiana using the graphical installer by double clicking the desktop icon labeled: \nInstall OpenIndiana\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the installer starts, the first screen you will see is the welcome page.\nWhen ready to begin the installation, click \nNext\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe top portion of the disk screen shows all the disks found on the system, including removable disks.\nThe installer also displays the size of each disk in Gigabytes (GB).\nWithin this upper panel, select the disk where you wish to install OpenIndiana.\n\n\nThe lower portion of this screen displays partitioning options.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nRegardless of the partitioning option chosen for the installation, manual control of the OpenSolaris file system layout is not supported.\nDuring the installation, the Solaris fdisk partition is reformatted with a default ZFS file system layout.\nAll existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed.\nThe installation uses a Solaris fdisk partition to create a ZFS storage pool.\n\n\n\nWithin the lower panel, select one of the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the whole disk\n\n\nWhen the \nUse the whole disk\n option is selected, the entire disk is used for the installation. For the selected disk, all existing partitions and any data which they may contain, will be overwritten with the OpenIndiana operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartition the disk\n\n\nWhen \nPartition the disk\n option is selected, the bottom portion of this panel displays the disk partitioning layout. Prior to selecting this option, please be sure to review all the informational notes and warnings concerning the use of the partitioning option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have revised the partitioning as needed, and are ready to continue on to the next screen, click Next.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nIf you choose to partition the disk, review the following partitioning guidelines, then revise the partitioning panel settings as needed.\n\n\n\n\nOnly one Solaris partition is allowed.\nIf an existing Solaris partition is available, that Solaris partition will be the target for the installation.\nOr, if you do not have an existing Solaris partition, you can change any existing partition to a Solaris partition.\n\n\nYou can resize existing partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel.\nFor this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target for the installation.\n\n\nIf you used a third-party partitioning tool such as GParted, then the Disk panel displays a partition named Linux-swap on which you can install OpenIndiana.\n\n\nIn this panel, use the drop-down list for the Linux-swap partition name to change the partition name to Solaris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nIf the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed, and the panel displays proposed partitioning.\nIn this case, all data on the selected disk is destroyed.\n\n\nIf the table can be read, then the following information applies:\n\n\n\n\nThe partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk.\n\n\nResizing a Solaris partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions.\n\n\nExisting data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout.\n\n\nHowever, resizing the last partition or appending a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Solaris partitions cannot be resized.\n\n\nTo make additional space available, you can change an existing partition to Unused.\n\n\nHowever, if you change an existing partition to Unused, all subsequent non-Solaris partitions are also changed to Unused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew partitions can only use the available space that follows the last defined partition.\n\n\nThe installer cannot utilize unallocated chunks of space between existing defined partitions.\n\n\nUse the fdisk(1M) command to create new partitions that use the free space between exiting partitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis screen enables you to type the correct time zone, date, and time for the system to be installed.\nThe top half of the panel displays a world map with major cities marked.\nThe bottom half of the panel provides drop-down selections.\nYou can choose the time zone either from the map or from the drop-down list.\n\n\n\n\nIf you select the time zone from the map, click on a city or click anywhere on the map.\n\n\n\n\nIf you click on the map, but not on a city, the map automatically magnifies that area.\nYou can click on a location within that magnified area.\nYou can drag the cursor to move the magnified area to a different location on the map.\nWhen you select a site on the map, the drop-down selections automatically populate with the time zone, date, and current time for that map selection.\nYou can right-click to undo magnification.\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using the map, you can make your selections in the drop-down fields.\n\n\n\n\nSelect your region, then select Location. Finally, select time zone.\nThe options for each drop-down field are determined by the selection made in the prior drop-down field.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nAfter making your selections, you may also edit the default date and time that is provided.\n\n\n\nWhen the settings are correct, click Next to continue.\n\n\n\n\nThis screen enables you to select a language and locale.\nThese selections determine the language support, the default date and time, and other data formats for the installed system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can accept the default language selection or change the selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA language selection is required.\nYou can select \u201cno default language support.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe language chosen automatically determines the available locales in the drop-down list.\nOnly one locale can be selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nAny time that you log in to the installed system, you can change either the locale for that particular session or the default locale by using the Options button in the Login dialog box.\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the following guidelines:\n\n\n\n\nRoot login is not enabled either on the Live CD or on the installed system.\nYou must log in as the user that you create in this panel.\nAfter you log in, you can then become root to configure the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nIf you do not create a user account in this panel, root is set up as a normal account on the installed system, instead of as a role.\nThis is the only situation where you can log in to the installed system as root.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the root password and user account are optional.\nHowever, for better security, do complete these fields.\nIf the root password is not defined, a reminder is displayed when you click Next.\nIf you do not want to define a root password, you can proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA user account requires only a Login name for the account to be valid.\nFor better security, however, do complete all fields.\nIf the user account information is not valid, a reminder is displayed when you click Next.\nIf you do not want to define a user account, you can proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType a computer name or accept the default.\nThe computer name field cannot be blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe installation begins when you click Install.\nDuring the installation, a progress bar is displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nDo not interrupt an installation in progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final screen displays completion messages.\nYou can review the installation log in this panel.\nTo exit the installer, select Quit and shut down your system.\nYou can either quit or reboot from this panel.\n\n\n\n\nAfter a successful installation, to start the installed system, select Reboot.\nThe reboot process might take a few minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nEject the Live CD as the next boot begins.\nOr, select the \u201cBoot from Hard Disk\u201d option on the GRUB menu.\n\n\n\nAfter you have installed OpenIndiana, if you have another operating system on your system, you might need to update the GRUB menu.\nThe GRUB menu displays a list of operating systems that can be booted.\nSolaris and Windows operating systems are displayed automatically on the GRUB menu.\nThe contents of the GRUB menu.lst file define what is displayed in the GRUB menu when you boot the system.\nIf you have an additional OpenIndiana or a Linux OS that is not displayed on the menu, you need to edit the GRUB menu.lst file.\n\n\nInstall OpenIndiana using the Text Installer\n\n\nThe text based guided install starts and runs within a command line console.\nNavigation within the installer is performed by pressing specifically designated navigation keys (F2, Tab, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nThe non-graphical text based bootable media installer also uses this very same \nText based Guided Install\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin installing OpenIndiana using the text based installer by double clicking the desktop icon labeled:\n\n\nInstall OpenIndiana using the Text Installer\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nInstall OpenIndiana using the Text Installer\n process begins with a welcome screen.\n\n\nThe welcome screen also provides:\n\n\n\n\nLocation of the installation log file\n\n\nNavigational guidance\n\n\n\n\nWhen ready to begin, press the F2 key to continue.\n\n\n\n\nThe installer identifies the disks which are available for installation.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have only a single disk, it is already selected.\n\n\nIf you have multiple disks, use the arrow keys to select the appropriate disk.\n\n\n\n\nWhen ready, press the F2 key to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nWhile the minimum and recommended disk sizes are technically accurate, they do not take into account periodic disk usage growth resulting from:\n\n\n\n\nZFS snapshots\n\n\nBackup boot environments created by \npkg install\n\n\nBoot environments created by \npkg update\n\n\n\n\nTo account for this, your disk should be at least 20GB or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nIf your disk contains a GPT disk label, the entire disk will be used.\n\n\n\n\nAny existing GPT partitions will be destroyed\n\n\nA new single GPT partition will be created.\n\n\n\n\nThis warning serves as your advisory.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf reformatting the entire disk is acceptable with you, press the enter key to continue.\nOtherwise use the arrow keys to select cancel and press the enter key..\n\n\nIf you select cancel, you will have the following options:\n\n\n\n\nSelect another disk\n\n\nAbort the installation so you may provide remedial action such as:\n\n\nModifying the partition table using Gparted\n\n\nAdding another disk to the system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this screen you are presented with the following choices for how to partition the disk:\n\n\n\n\nUse the whole disk (EFI)\n\n\nUse a partition of the disk (MBR)\n\n\n\n\nUsing the arrow keys, select the appropriate choice.\nWhen ready, press the F2 key to continue.\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the computer name (system hostname) you wish to use.\nBy default the computer name is \nopenindiana\n.\nUsing the backspace key, you may remove

measured by means of a status bar.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the installation has completed you are presented with a summary screen.\nThe installation logs are available by pressing the F4 key.\nIf you ran the installation from Live Media, you may exit the installation by pressing the F9 key.\nOtherwise, you will want to reboot the system by pressing the F8 key.\n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana using the text installer (DVD ISO or USB)\n\n\nThe text installer DVD ISO and USB installer options are not graphical nor do they provide a live environment.\nWhen booting from the text based installer, you are presented with the following choices:\n\n\n\n\nInstall OpenIndiana\n\n\nSpawn a shell to be used as a rescue disk.\n\n\n\n\nThe procedure for installing from the text based installer follows the same process as the previously described \nInstall OpenIndiana using the Text Installer\n\n\nPost installation steps\n\n\nResetting the root password\n\n\nThe root password is immediately expired after installation and you will need to choose a new one.\n\n\nUse the following steps to change the root password:\n\n\n\n\nopen a Terminal\n\n\nexecute \nsu -\n and give the password you chose for your account at installation time\n\n\nyou will be informed that root's password has expired and prompted to change it\n\n\nonce changed you can exit the su session\n\n\nYou should be able to login/authenticate as root now.\n\n\n\n\nResetting the root password does not allow root to login via ssh.\n\n\nTroubleshooting installations\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not see a menu after booting your computer with the DVD or USB device, and instead see some text and a \ngrub\n prompt, there may be an error in your copy of the installer, or it was created incorrectly.\n\n\nIf you see a \nlogin:\n prompt after selecting your keyboard and language and no desktop appears after several seconds, there may be a problem with the drivers for your graphics hardware.\n\n\nPlease let us know via IRC or the mailing list if this happens.\n\n\nWhen you contact us, please include any error messages you see on the console, as well as the output of the \nsvcs -xv\n command.\n\n\nIf possible, also include the contents of the file \n/var/log/Xorg.0.log\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSB 3.0 issues\n\n\nDOC TEAM NOTE:\n\n\nBring this guidance in alignment with the USB 3.0 warnings found elsewhere in the handbook, FAQ, etc.\n\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster does not currently support USB3.\n\n\nYou cannot boot a USB thumbdrive installer from a USB3 port.\n\n\n\n\nThe Image Package System (IPS)\n\n\nThe image packaging system is delivered as part of the OpenIndiana userland.\nAs such, the pkg related man pages are not available on the illumos.org website.\nThese pages are only available by running the man page viewer locally on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDOC TEAM NOTE:\n\n\n\n\nHave a look at: \npgk cheat sheet\n to see whether there is anything there which we might want to import and validate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter an initial installation of the OpenIndiana Hipster operating system, you will find many of the software applications you use on a regular basis are not immediately available to you.\nThese software applications are available as packages in a remote Image Packaging System (IPS) repository for downloading and installing over the Internet.\n\n\nWritten in Python, IPS is a network-centric packaging system which enables users to connect to a remote repository for the purpose of downloading and installing packages.\nOpenIndiana Hipster uses IPS for its packaging system.\n\n\nBesides installing packages from a repository, users can also perform the following tasks:\n\n\n\n\nCreate and publish their own IPS packages\n\n\nSet up an OpenIndiana Hipster repository\n\n\nMirror an existing repository\n\n\nPublish existing packages to a repository\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have installed packages, IPS enables you to search, update, and manage those packages on your system.\n\n\nWith IPS , you can upgrade your system to a newer build of OpenIndiana Hipster, install and update your software to the latest available versions, and retrieve packages from mirror repositories.\n\n\nIf the system on which IPS is installed is located on a network, IPS can automatically access the OpenIndiana Hipster package repository.\nFor OpenIndiana Hipster, your IPS client can access the packages from \nhttps://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster\n.\n\n\nIPS packages\n\n\nAn IPS package is defined as a collection of files, directories, links, drivers and dependencies in a defined format.\n\n\nNote the following points about IPS packages:\n\n\n\n\nAn IPS package consists of a set of actions.\nActions are defined when an IPS package is created.\nActions are used for defining the files and directories of the package, setting package attributes, declaring dependencies on other packages, creating users and groups, and installing device drivers.\nSome actions may optionally have tags that provide meta information about the action such as locale information and debug configuration.\n\n\n\n\nIPS package archives (.p5p)\n\n\nWhen the IPS system was originally conceived there was no standard on-disk format for an IPS package.\nHence, unlike a .rpm file, an SVR4 package, or a .nbm file, it was not possible to transfer an IPS package from system to system.\nThe remote IPS repository where the IPS package resided was the only source for the package.\nThis is because in its native state, the IPS package is not something you can normally download as a single archive file.\n\n\nRecognizing this limitation of IPS, the \n.p5p\n IPS archive format was developed.\nFor IPS archives, files are stored in the pax archive format, along with additional metadata, such as IPS manifest files, and a specific layout of the contents.\nThe \npkgrecv\n command is used to create IPS archives.\n\n\nFor example, to create a \n.p5p\n IPS package archive containing the package \neditor/gnu-emacs\n and all of its dependencies from the repository located at \nhttp://example.com:10000\n, use the following command:\n\n\npkgrecv -s http://example.com:10000 -d /my/emacs.p5p -a -r editor/gnu-emacs\n\n\n\n\nIPS commands\n\n\nThe Image Packaging System software provides the following commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg\n1\n\n\nUse the \npkg\n1\n command to create an image, to install packages to your image, and to manage packages on your image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkgsend\n1\n\n\nUse the \npkgsend\n1\n command to publish packages from your image to an existing repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg.depotd\n1M\n\n\nUse the \npkg.depotd\n1M\n command to create and manage your own network repository or set up a mirror repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkgrecv\n\n\nUse the \npkgrecv\n command to download the contents of a package from a server. The user can then modify the contents by adding additional package attributes and republish the package with the \npkgsend\n command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \npkg\n5\n man page describes the overall Image Packaging System.\n\n\nThe \npkg\n1\n man page describes the image packaging retrieval client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg\n1\n uses FMRIs\n\n\nEach IPS package is represented by a \nFault Management Resource Identifier\n (FMRI).\nThe pkg\n1\n command uses valid FMRI package information to perform its command actions.\nThe FMRI includes descriptive information about the package, such as the package name, version information, and date.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nFMRI: pkg://openindiana.org/image/editor/gimp@2.8.16-2016.0.0.0:20160702T042138Z\n\n\n\n\nScheme \u2013 pkg\n\n\nAuthority \u2013 openindiana.org\n\n\nPackageName \u2013 gimp\n\n\nVersion String \u2013 Consists of three components :\n\n\nBuild Version \u2013 2.8.16\n\n\nBranch Version \u2013 2016.0.0.0\n\n\nTimestamp \u2013 20160702T042138Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearching for packages\n\n\nThe \npkg search\n command is used to search locally or remotely for information about packages.\nIf no search options are specified, the search is restricted to the local system.\nUsing the \n-r\n option, the command searches the remote repository (or repositories) associated with the system.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg search -r xchat\n\n\nINDEX                ACTION VALUE                                   PACKAGE\npkg.summary          set    HexChat is an IRC client based on XChat pkg:/desktop/irc/hexchat@2.12.1-2016.0.0.1\npkg.summary          set    XChat IRC Client                        pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5\nbasename             file   usr/bin/xchat                           pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5\ncom.oracle.info.name set    xchat                                   pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5\npkg.fmri             set    openindiana.org/desktop/irc/xchat       pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5\n\n\n\n\nThe \npkg search\n command may also be used to find the package containing a particular file.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg search -l /usr/bin/gpg2\n\n\nINDEX      ACTION VALUE        PACKAGE\npath       file   usr/bin/gpg2 pkg:/crypto/gnupg@2.0.28-2016.0.0.0\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the \npkg search\n command bear it mind it works much like the Unix \nfind\n command.\nIf you have troubles finding a package you know should exist, try using wildcards with your commands.\n\n\nListing information about packages\n\n\nTo list information about packages installed on the local system use the command \npkg list \npackage-name\n.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg list gimp\n\n\nNAME (PUBLISHER)                                  VERSION                    IFO\nimage/editor/gimp                                 2.8.16-2016.0.0.2          i--\n\n\n\n\nTo list the entire contents of a package, use the command: \npkg contents \npackage-name\n.\nIf the package is not installed on the local system, use the \n-r\n option.\n\n\nThe \npkg contents\n command can also be used to list the dependencies found in a package.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg contents -H -t depend -o fmri xchat\n\n\npkg:/library/desktop/gdk-pixbuf@2.31.6-2016.0.0.0\npkg:/library/desktop/gtk2@2.24.30-2016.0.0.0\npkg:/library/desktop/libsexy@0.1.11-2016.0.0.0\npkg:/library/desktop/pango@1.36.8-2016.0.0.2\npkg:/library/glib2@2.43.4-2016.0.0.3\npkg:/library/security/openssl@1.0.2.8-2016.0.0.3\npkg:/runtime/perl-522@5.22.1-2016.0.0.1\npkg:/runtime/python-27@2.7.12-2016.0.0.0\npkg:/runtime/tcl-8@8.5.19-2016.0.0.1\npkg:/system/library/libdbus-glib@0.100.2-2016.0.0.0\npkg:/system/library@0.5.11-2016.0.0.15685\npkg:/x11/library/libx11@1.6.3-2016.0.0.0\n\n\n\n\nInstalling packages\n\n\nUse the following command to install a package.\n\n\npkg install [-v] \npackage-name\n\n\nWhen installing packages, use of the \n-v\n (verbose) switch is entirely optional.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg install xchat\n\n\n           Packages to install:   1\n            Packages to update:   1\n            Services to change:   2\n       Create boot environment:  No\nCreate backup

newer versions of specific packages or package groups and installs them if they are available.\nAny dependent packages are also automatically updated.\n\n\nTo install a specific version of a package you may substitute the common name for the FMRI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating packages\n\n\nTo update all the packages installed on a system to their latest available version, use the \npkg update\n

Even if later versions of the package are available in other publishers, those later versions are not installed by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage updates: package originally installed from preferred publisher\n\n\nIf the package was originally installed from the preferred publisher, then the latest available update of the package can be installed from the \ncurrent\n preferred publisher. The package can be install from the \ncurrent\n preferred even if the preferred publisher designation had been moved to another publisher after the package had been originally installed. Even if later versions of the package are available in other publishers, those later versions are not installed by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage updates: package originally installed from non-preferred publisher\n\n\nIf the package was originally installed from a non-preferred publisher, then the latest available update of the package is installed from the publisher from which the package was originally installed. Even if later versions of the package are available in other publishers, those later versions are not installed by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListing package history\n\n\nTo list the IPS transactional

SVR4 packages.\nHere are some of the available tools:\n\n\n\n\npkginfo\n\n\npkgadd\n\n\npkgrm\n\n\n\n\n3rd party package management tools\n\n\nIn addition to IPS and SVR4 package management tools, it is also possible to use \npkgsrc\n.\n\n\nFor more information about pkgsrc, see the \nJoyent package source website\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nThe use of 3rd party repositories and package managers increases the likelihood of conflicts between package versions and their dependencies.\nFurthermore, the OpenIndiana project cannot guarantee the qualify of packages obtained from 3rd party repositories.\nTherefore, use 3rd party repositories and 3rd party package tools at your own risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging boot environments\n\n\nA boot environment is a bootable instance of an OpenIndiana operating system image plus any other application software packages installed into that image.\nYou can maintain multiple boot environments on your system, and each boot environment could have different software versions installed.\nUpon the initial installation of OpenIndiana onto your system, a boot environment is created.\nUse the \nbeadm\n1M\n utility to administer additional boot environments on your system.\n\n\nThe \nbeadmn\n utility is designed to work in concert with the ZFS file system and the IPS package manager.\n\n\nWhy use multiple boot environments?\n\n\nWith multiple boot environments, the process of updating software becomes a low risk operation because you can create backup boot environments before making any software updates to your system.\nIf needed, you have the option of booting a backup boot environment.\n\n\nHere are some specific examples where having more than one OpenIndiana boot environment, and managing them with the \nbeadm\n utility, is useful:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use the \npkg update\n command to update all the packages in your active OpenIndiana boot environment, this process automatically creates a clone of that boot environment.\nThe packages are updated in the clone rather than in the original boot environment.\nAfter successfully completing the updates, the new clone is activated.\nThen, the clone will become the new default boot environment on the next reboot.\nThe original boot environment remains on the GRUB menu as an alternate selection.\nYou can use the \nbeadm list\n command to see a list of all the boot environments on the system, including the backup boot environment that still has its original, unchanged software.\nIf you are not satisfied with the updates made to the environment, you can use the \nbeadm activate\n command to specify that the backup will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are modifying a boot environment, you can take a snapshot of that environment at any stage during modifications by using the \nbeadm create\n command.\nA snapshot is a read-only image of a dataset or boot environment at a given point in time.\nYou can create custom names for each snapshot that identify when or why the snapshot was created.\nFor example, if you are doing monthly upgrades to your boot environment, you can capture snapshots for each monthly upgrade.\nYou can use the \nbeadm list -s\n command to view the available snapshots for a boot environment.\nA snapshot is not bootable.\nBut, you can create a boot environment, based on that snapshot, by using the \n-e\n option for the \nbeadm create\n command.\nThen you can use the \nbeadm activate\n command to specify that this boot environment will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can maintain more than one boot environment on your system, and perform various upgrades on each of them as needed.\nFor example, you can clone a boot environment by using the \nbeadm create\n command.\nA clone is a bootable copy of a boot environment.\nThen, you can install, test, and update different software packages on the original boot environment and on its clone.\nAlthough only one boot environment can be active at a time, you can mount an inactive boot environment by using the \nbeadm mount\n command.\nThen you can use the \npkg image-update\n command with the \n-R\n option to update all the packages in that inactive, mounted environment.\nOr, use the \npkg install packagename\n with the \n-R\n option to update specific packages on that environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of the beadm utility\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility has the following features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility aggregates all datasets in a boot environment and performs actions on the entire boot environment at once.\nYou no longer need to perform ZFS commands to modify each dataset individually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility manages the dataset structures within boot environments.\nFor example, when the \nbeadm\n utility clones a boot environment that has shared datasets, the utility automatically recognizes and manages those shared datasets for the new boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility enables you to perform administrative tasks on your boot environments.\nThese tasks can be performed without upgrading your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility automatically manages and updates the GRUB menu.\nFor example, when you use the \nbeadm\n utility to create a new boot environment, that environment is automatically added to the GRUB menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility enables you to perform the following tasks:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new boot environment based on the active boot environment\n\n\nCreate a new boot environment based on an inactive boot environment\n\n\nCreate a snapshot of an existing boot environment\n\n\nCreate a new boot environment based on an existing snapshot\n\n\nCreate a new boot environment and add a custom title to the GRUB menu.\n\n\nActivate an existing, inactive boot environment\n\n\nMount a boot environment\n\n\nUnmount a boot environment\n\n\nDestroy a boot environment\n\n\nDestroy a snapshot of a boot environment\n\n\nRename an existing, inactive boot environment\n\n\nDisplay information about your boot environment snapshots and datasets\n\n\n\n\nbeadm command reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm\n\n\nDisplays command usage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm activate \nBE\n\n\nMakes the specified boot environment the active boot environment upon the next reboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm create \nBE\n\n\nCreates a new boot environment with the name specified. Unless the -e option is provided, the new boot environment is created as a clone of the currently running boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm create \nBE@snapshot\n\n\nCreates a snapshot of the existing boot environment with the specified snapshot name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm destroy \nBE\n\n\nDestroys the boot environment named BE or destroys an existing snapshot, BE@snapshot, of a boot environment. Prompts for confirmation before destroying the boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm list \nBE\n\n\nLists information about the specified boot environment, or lists information for all boot environments if a boot environment name is not provided. The default is to list boot environments without any additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm mount \nBE\n \nmountpoint\n\n\nMounts the specified boot environment at the specified mount point. The mount point must be an already existing, empty directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm rename \nold BE\n \nnew BE\n\n\nRenames the specified boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm unmount [-f] \nBE\n\n\nUnmounts the specified boot environment. \n-f\n \u2013 Forcefully unmounts the boot environment even if it is currently busy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor detailed instructions about the \nbeadm\n utility, see the \nbeadm\n1M\n man page.\n\n\nbeadm zones support\n\n\nZones partitioning technology is used to virtualize operating system services and provide an isolated and secure environment for running applications.\nEach OpenIndiana system is a global zone.\nWithin a global zone, specific non-global zones can be created.\n\n\nZones support limitations\n\n\nNote the following limitations of support for non-global zones in the beadm utility and in related processes:\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use the pkg image-update command, the command only upgrades ipkg branded zones.\n\n\nThe beadm utility is not supported inside a non-global zone.\n\n\nNon-global zone support is limited to ZFS support. Zones are not supported unless they are on ZFS.\n\n\nZones are not supported in the rpool/ROOT namespace. Non-global zones are cloned or copied only when the original zone is within the shared area for the global zone, for example, within rpool/export or within rpool/zones.\n\n\nAlthough the beadm utility affects the non-global zones on your system, the beadm utility does not display zones information. Use the zoneadm utility to view changes in the\nzones in your boot environment. For example, use the zoneadm list command to view a list of all current zones on the system.\n\n\n\n\nFor further information, see the \nzoneadm\n1M\n man page.\n\n\nZones support specifications\n\n\nThe beadm command impacts the non-global zones in your boot environments as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nSupport Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm create\n\n\nWhen you clone a boot environment by using the beadm create command, all zones in that boot environment are copied into the new boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm destroy\n\n\nWhen you destroy an inactive boot environment, the zones that belong to that boot environment are also destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm mount\n\n\nWhen you mount a boot environment, the zones in that environment are mounted relative to the mount points for the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm unmount\n\n\nWhen you unmount a boot environment, the zones in that environment are also unmounted. All mount points are returned to their states prior to being mounted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm rename\n\n\nWhen you rename a boot environment, that change does not impact the names of the zones or the names of the datasets that are used for those zones in that boot environment. The change does not impact the relationships between the zones and their related boot environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe X-Window system\n\n\n placeholder \n\n\nVideo card support (3D)\n\n\nNearly all cards are supported for 2nd, but only Nvidia is supported for 3D.\nWork is progressing to provide support for AMD and Intel.\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\nTalk about the expected behavior when booting the live CD from a system with an NVIDIA card.\n\n\nDiscuss procedure for adding an NVIDIA card to a system that was using VESA or some other non-3d video driver.\n\n\nTroubleshooting - what logs to look at, manual configuration, etc.\n\n\nWalk through NVIDIA utility screens.\n\n\n\n\nAMD\n\n\n\n\nCurrently no 3rd support, VESA driver only.\n\n\n\n\nIntel\n\n\n\n\nStill working to incorporate this into Hipster.\n\n\n\n\nHow does one add a missing device driver?\n\n\n Write about finding hardware id's, searching for drivers, installing, loading, /etc/driver_alias'es file.",

When the installer starts, the first screen you will see is the welcome page.\nWhen ready to begin the installation, click  Next .   The top portion of the disk screen shows all the disks found on the system, including removable disks.\nThe installer also displays the size of each disk in Gigabytes (GB).\nWithin this upper panel, select the disk where you wish to install OpenIndiana.  The lower portion of this screen displays partitioning options.     NOTE:  \nRegardless of the partitioning option chosen for the installation, manual control of the OpenSolaris file system layout is not supported.\nDuring the installation, the Solaris fdisk partition is reformatted with a default ZFS file system layout.\nAll existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed.\nThe installation uses a Solaris fdisk partition to create a ZFS storage pool.  Within the lower panel, select one of the following options:     Option  Description      Use the whole disk  When the  Use the whole disk  option is selected, the entire disk is used for the installation. For the selected disk, all existing partitions and any data which they may contain, will be overwritten with the OpenIndiana operating system.    Partition the disk  When  Partition the disk  option is selected, the bottom portion of this panel displays the disk partitioning layout. Prior to selecting this option, please be sure to review all the informational notes and warnings concerning the use of the partitioning option.     When you have revised the partitioning as needed, and are ready to continue on to the next screen, click Next.     NOTE:  \nIf you choose to partition the disk, review the following partitioning guidelines, then revise the partitioning panel settings as needed.   Only one Solaris partition is allowed.\nIf an existing Solaris partition is available, that Solaris partition will be the target for the installation.\nOr, if you do not have an existing Solaris partition, you can change any existing partition to a Solaris partition.  You can resize existing partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel.\nFor this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target for the installation.  If you used a third-party partitioning tool such as GParted, then the Disk panel displays a partition named Linux-swap on which you can install OpenIndiana.  In this panel, use the drop-down list for the Linux-swap partition name to change the partition name to Solaris.        CAUTION:  \nIf the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed, and the panel displays proposed partitioning.\nIn this case, all data on the selected disk is destroyed.  If the table can be read, then the following information applies:   The partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk.  Resizing a Solaris partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions.  Existing data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout.  However, resizing the last partition or appending a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions.    Non-Solaris partitions cannot be resized.  To make additional space available, you can change an existing partition to Unused.  However, if you change an existing partition to Unused, all subsequent non-Solaris partitions are also changed to Unused.    New partitions can only use the available space that follows the last defined partition.  The installer cannot utilize unallocated chunks of space between existing defined partitions.  Use the fdisk(1M) command to create new partitions that use the free space between exiting partitions.    This screen enables you to type the correct time zone, date, and time for the system to be installed.\nThe top half of the panel displays a world map with major cities marked.\nThe bottom half of the panel provides drop-down selections.\nYou can choose the time zone either from the map or from the drop-down list.   If you select the time zone from the map, click on a city or click anywhere on the map.   If you click on the map, but not on a city, the map automatically magnifies that area.\nYou can click on a location within that magnified area.\nYou can drag the cursor to move the magnified area to a different location on the map.\nWhen you select a site on the map, the drop-down selections automatically populate with the time zone, date, and current time for that map selection.\nYou can right-click to undo magnification.   Instead of using the map, you can make your selections in the drop-down fields.   Select your region, then select Location. Finally, select time zone.\nThe options for each drop-down field are determined by the selection made in the prior drop-down field.     NOTE:  \nAfter making your selections, you may also edit the default date and time that is provided.  When the settings are correct, click Next to continue.   This screen enables you to select a language and locale.\nThese selections determine the language support, the default date and time, and other data formats for the installed system.    You can accept the default language selection or change the selection.    A language selection is required.\nYou can select \u201cno default language support.\u201d    The language chosen automatically determines the available locales in the drop-down list.\nOnly one locale can be selected.

Note the following points about IPS packages:   An IPS package consists of a set of actions.\nActions are defined when an IPS package is created.\nActions are used for defining the files and directories of the package, setting package attributes, declaring dependencies on other packages, creating users and groups, and installing device drivers.\nSome actions may optionally have tags that provide meta information about the action such as locale information and debug configuration.",

Recognizing this limitation of IPS, the  .p5p  IPS archive format was developed.\nFor IPS archives, files are stored in the pax archive format, along with additional metadata, such as IPS manifest files, and a specific layout of the contents.\nThe  pkgrecv  command is used to create IPS archives.  For example, to create a  .p5p  IPS package archive containing the package  editor/gnu-emacs  and all of its dependencies from the repository located at  http://example.com:10000 , use the following command:  pkgrecv -s http://example.com:10000 -d /my/emacs.p5p -a -r editor/gnu-emacs",

Here are some specific examples where having more than one OpenIndiana boot environment, and managing them with the  beadm  utility, is useful:    When you use the  pkg update  command to update all the packages in your active OpenIndiana boot environment, this process automatically creates a clone of that boot environment.\nThe packages are updated in the clone rather than in the original boot environment.\nAfter successfully completing the updates, the new clone is activated.\nThen, the clone will become the new default boot environment on the next reboot.\nThe original boot environment remains on the GRUB menu as an alternate selection.\nYou can use the  beadm list  command to see a list of all the boot environments on the system, including the backup boot environment that still has its original, unchanged software.\nIf you are not satisfied with the updates made to the environment, you can use the  beadm activate  command to specify that the backup will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.    If you are modifying a boot environment, you can take a snapshot of that environment at any stage during modifications by using the  beadm create  command.\nA snapshot is a read-only image of a dataset or boot environment at a given point in time.\nYou can create custom names for each snapshot that identify when or why the snapshot was created.\nFor example, if you are doing monthly upgrades to your boot environment, you can capture snapshots for each monthly upgrade.\nYou can use the  beadm list -s  command to view the available snapshots for a boot environment.\nA snapshot is not bootable.\nBut, you can create a boot environment, based on that snapshot, by using the  -e  option for the  beadm create  command.\nThen you can use the  beadm activate  command to specify that this boot environment will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.    You can maintain more than one boot environment on your system, and perform various upgrades on each of them as needed.\nFor example, you can clone a boot environment by using the  beadm create  command.\nA clone is a bootable copy of a boot environment.\nThen, you can install, test, and update different software packages on the original boot environment and on its clone.\nAlthough only one boot environment can be active at a time, you can mount an inactive boot environment by using the  beadm mount  command.\nThen you can use the  pkg image-update  command with the  -R  option to update all the packages in that inactive, mounted environment.\nOr, use the  pkg install packagename  with the  -R  option to update specific packages on that environment.",

The  beadm  utility manages the dataset structures within boot environments.\nFor example, when the  beadm  utility clones a boot environment that has shared datasets, the utility automatically recognizes and manages those shared datasets for the new boot environment.    The  beadm  utility enables you to perform administrative tasks on your boot environments.\nThese tasks can be performed without upgrading your system.    The  beadm  utility automatically manages and updates the GRUB menu.\nFor example, when you use the  beadm  utility to create a new boot environment, that environment is automatically added to the GRUB menu.    The  beadm  utility enables you to perform the following tasks:   Create a new boot environment based on the active boot environment  Create a new boot environment based on an inactive boot environment  Create a snapshot of an existing boot environment  Create a new boot environment based on an existing snapshot  Create a new boot environment and add a custom title to the GRUB menu.

Zones are not supported in the rpool/ROOT namespace. Non-global zones are cloned or copied only when the original zone is within the shared area for the global zone, for example, within rpool/export or within rpool/zones.  Although the beadm utility affects the non-global zones on your system, the beadm utility does not display zones information. Use the zoneadm utility to view changes in the\nzones in your boot environment. For example, use the zoneadm list command to view a list of all current zones on the system.

This change was implemented in preparation for the OpenSolaris 2010.03 release.\nThe proposed release notes for OpenSolaris 2010.03 included this statement: \"CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment. A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer. To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services.\"\nDoc Team Notes:\n Oracle Solaris dropped support for lp when they introduced CUPS in the Solaris 11.0 release. The OpenIndiana project retained both print subsystems, which are managed by the \nprint-service\n command. Both \nlp\n and \nlpr\n are symbolically linked to \nprint-service\n. Issuing the command \nprint-service -q\n shows the active print subsystem, which by default is CUPS.

Deprecation notes:  Subsequent to the release of OpenSolaris 2009.06, the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) was selected as the default print service, however, the lp print service was retained. This change was implemented in preparation for the OpenSolaris 2010.03 release. The proposed release notes for OpenSolaris 2010.03 included this statement: \"CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment. A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer. To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services.\" Doc Team Notes:  Oracle Solaris dropped support for lp when they introduced CUPS in the Solaris 11.0 release. The OpenIndiana project retained both print subsystems, which are managed by the  print-service  command. Both  lp  and  lpr  are symbolically linked to  print-service . Issuing the command  print-service -q  shows the active print subsystem, which by default is CUPS. More information can be found in the print-service (1M) man page.

DTrace will allow you to explore your system to understand how it works, track down performance problems across many layers of software, or locate the cause of aberrant behavior. \nAs you'll see, DTrace lets you create your own custom programs to dynamically instrument the system and provide immediate, concise answers to arbitrary questions you can formulate using the DTrace \nD\n programming language. \nDTrace allows all Solaris users to:\nDynamically enable and manage thousands of probes\nDynamically associate logical predicates and actions with probes\nDynamically manage trace buffers and buffer policies\nDisplay and examine trace data from the live system or a crash dump\nDTrace allows Solaris developers and administrators to:\nImplement custom scripts that use the DTrace facility\nImplement layered tools that use DTrace to retrieve trace data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nBasic familiarity with a programming language such as \nC\n or a scripting language such as \nawk(1)\n or \nperl(1)\n will help you learn DTrace and the \nD\n programming language faster, but you need not be an expert in any of these areas.

Simply replace \n\"**/*.md\"\n with the path to the file.\n\n\nEnabling spell checking in vim\n\n\nYou can invoke spell checking in your current session by inputting the command:\n\n\n:set spell spelllang=en_us\n\n\nIf you would like a more permanent solution, enable spell checking in your \n.vimrc\n by adding the line:\n\n\nset spelllang=en_us\n\n\nMisspelled words will now be highlighted (color varies dependent on your .Xresources file)\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts for spell checking in vim\n\n\n\n\n]s\n to find the previously misspelled word.\n\n\n[s\n to find the next misspelled word.\n\n\nWith the cursor at the beginning of a word, use \nz=\n to bring up a list of suggested replacements.\n\n\nzg\n will add a word to the local dictionary exception file.\n\n\nzw\n is used to mark a word as incorrect.\n\n\n\n\nCommit and push your changes.\n\n\ngit status\ngit add some-file-you-just-edited\ngit commit -m 'your commit message'\ngit push\n\n\n\n\nSend a pull request.\n\n\n\n\nOpen your web browser to your forked copy of the OpenIndiana Docs repository.\n\n\n\n\nFor example: \nhttps://github.com/your-user-name/oi-docs\n\n\n\n\nClick the button for \nNew pull request\n.\n\n\nAdd some notes about your change.\n\n\nSubmit your PR (pull request).\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\nAt this point someone with commit rights to the upstream repository will examine your changes.\nIf no corrections are required, your changes will be accepted and merged into the upstream repository.\n\n\nUpon commit, publishing occurs automatically using Travis-CI.",

Doc team Note: The guidance provided by the OSOL printing administration book is largely obsolete (but parts may still be valid) as CUPS replaced the old Solaris printing subsystem found in OpenSolaris 2009.06.\nHowever, OpenIndiana has 2 print subsystems (CUPS and LP).\nThey are managed by the  print-service  command, which allows you to designate the active print subsystem.\nSee the print-services (1M) man page for more information.\nIn contrast, Oracle dropped lp completely in the Solaris 11.0 release.",

2012.\n\n\nProbably a good idea to clean these up and incorporated the information into the page as appropriate.\n\n\nComments with such old timestamps suggests little site activity has occurred in last 4-5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark old pages for deprecation\n\n\n\n\nGo through the Wiki and mark content as obsolete.\n\n\nRetain items of value and either pull them into the new handbook (if it's helpful for new users), or set it aside for reference when updating the OpenSolaris books.\n\n\nReorganize things which are not being moved.\n\n\n\n\nWordPress Improvements\n\n\nImprove the presentation of reference materials\n\n\nillumos and OpenIndiana HCL's\n\n\n\n\nStart a discussion about ways to improve and update this.\n\n\nIllumos HLC: \nhttps://www.illumos.org/hcl/\n\n\n\n\nPublishing man pages online\n\n\n\n\nStart a discussion about getting the Hipster man pages published.\n\n\nillumos core man pages are available on illumos.org\n\n\nOI specific man pages are not published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleoric\n looking at Ubuntu dhcp.conf online man page, I thought it would be good to have automatic extractor and search interface, extracting man pages from package repository and publishing them on OI site...\n\nalanc\n http://illumos.org/man/ covers the illumos ones, but not all the other packages\n\nleoric\n I know about illumos man pages, but thought about all available man pages\n\nalanc\n yeah, I figured that's what you meant\n\n\n\n\nLinks to source code\n\n\n\n\nTalk about the links to the source code and what can be found in each repository.\n\n\nhttps://hg.openindiana.org/sustaining/\n\n\nhttps://hg.openindiana.org/upstream/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of OpenIndiana's web presence\n\n\n\n\nThe current OI website is a marked improvement over what previously existed.\nBut anything that is already good can be further improved.\n\n\nWe should begin a strategic discussion about the future direction of web content in general.\n\n\ne.g. do we continue using CMS systems, or start looking at static html?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWondering if we can expand on the Hipster name, perhaps by theming the website in a similar manor.\n\n\nHipster denotes something trendy, or in fashion, etc., the website theme should exploit this in some way.\n\n\nCould try something some like big fashionable buttons as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButton label\n\n\nURL points to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet it\n\n\nHipster Downloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall it\n\n\nInstallation Guidance/Tutorials/Instructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse it\n\n\nHipster Handbook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss it\n\n\nOI Mailing lists/IRC, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtend it\n\n\nDeveloper Handbook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavicon\n\n\n\n\nCan we add the OI favicon to WordPress like we see on the Wiki?\n\n\n\n\nMobile Devices\n\n\n\n\nDue to the dark blue color scheme, this menu is hard to see and easily missed.\n\n\nMaybe we should put something on the front page mentioning the mobile menu which is available in the upper left hand corner.\n\n\nPerhaps the color of the 3 bars mobile menu can be changed to white or something?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Thoughts (in no particular order)\n\n\n\n\nAdd some links to the Community \n Getting Involved page.\n\n\n#oi-dev IRC chat archives\n\n\n#openindiana IRC chat archives\n\n\noi-dev mailing list archives\n\n\nopenindiana mailing list archives\n\n\n\n\ntwitter @openindiana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave redirects (mailing lists, illumos links, etc., ) open into a new tab so OI webpage remains open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove link to WIKI to a more prominent location (e.g. its own first level tab on home page). Wiki is currently listed last under documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore frequent updates to Latest News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity \n Security Advisories is misleading.\n\n\n\n\nThis only leads to page to report problems, not view already reported advisories as the breadcrumbs would suggest.\n\n\nPerhaps we could find a way to make this more clear (e.g. Report security issues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation \n Gallery - Lets update the screenshots - should be from Hipster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove old pingbacks.\n\n\n\n\nThey don\u2019t look to offer any real value (e.g. the download page has 68 pingbacks).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog aggregator\n\n\n\n\nPost old OpenSolaris docs (as they are updated)\n\n\nAs the books are updated, replace them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide PDF and Epub alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd list of mirrors, torrents, etc., to download page on website.\n\n\n\n\nNeed to find more places to mirror, preferably some in north america too.\n\n\nOriginal list of mirrors",

            "text": "The OpenSolaris Redistributable Books\n\n\nThe 2009.09.15 docs drop consists of 41 books organized into several different collections.\nObviously maintaining 41 different titles is no easy matter.\nTherefore, the number one thing we can do to improve the books is to consolidate them into a more manageable set of fewer volumes.\nIn reviewing these books, there looks to be some crossover between titles.\nFor example, it might be possible to merge the Solaris Express collection into the Systems Administration collection, etc.\n\n\nCurrent Situation\n\n\nThe source code used for the redistributable books is Solbook XML 3.5 (and in some cases Solbook XML 3.6).\n\n\n\n\nSolbook is a creation of Sun Microsystems and is a simplified subset of Docbook.\n\n\nWe have a conversion tool (written in JAVA) which can handle the conversion of Solbook XML 3.5 to HTML 4.5, but we do not have DTD's for any other XML versions (e.g 3.6).\n\n\nAssuming the differences between the XML versions are not too great, we might be able to trick the java conversion tool by simply changing the version number within the DTD.\n\n\nThis is speculative and not yet been tried.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts unclear whether the books found in the 2009.09.15 drop are inclusive of all the 2008.11 books.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the titles are different.\n\n\nWe have the source for the 2009.06 books, but not for the 2008.11 books.\n\n\n\n\nChallenges for working with the OpenSolaris Books\n\n\nSolbook XML is difficult to work with.\n\n\n\n\nHard to read\n\n\nHard to edit\n\n\nRequires validation after editing\n\n\nNot supported by modern WYSIWIG XML editors\n\n\nThe Solbook to html conversion tool is broken (indexing does not work).\n\n\nConversion of the books is a manual process.\n\n\nWe have no automated way to maintain these books (no automated continuous integration toolchain exists).\n\n\n\n\nThe OpenSolaris books are full of broken links.\n\n\n\n\nThe books all reference each other (and other non-opensource books) using the original SUN hosted URL's.\n\n\nEven the books revised by the illumos project have broken links (thus also need some love).\n\n\n\n\nThere are additional challenges.\n\n\n\n\nThe books have difficult to decipher folder and xml file names.\n\n\nMany of the books consist of dozens and dozens of separate xml files.\n\n\nThe books are not particularly mobile friendly.\n\n\nIn regard to the factual correctness of the documentation, do we ourselves even know what still works, doesn't work, has been deprecated, replaced, etc.?\n\n\n\n\nFuture Direction\n\n\nWe should consider converting the OpenSolaris books to some kind of simple and easy to read text based markup (e.g. ASCIIDOC, Restructured Text, Markdown, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nUsing a text based markup would greatly lower the bar for working on the books.\n\n\nFor books for which we do not have the XML source, perhaps pandoc can be used to reconvert the HTML back to text markup.\n\n\n\n\nWe need to create a fully automated toolchain with the following features:\n\n\n\n\nSource code stored on GitHub.\n\n\nCommit hooks kick off an automated build (conversion to HTML5) and deployment of the books to their public location.\n\n\nWe need to determine where to host the books -

The OpenSolaris books are full of broken links.   The books all reference each other (and other non-opensource books) using the original SUN hosted URL's.  Even the books revised by the illumos project have broken links (thus also need some love).   There are additional challenges.   The books have difficult to decipher folder and xml file names.  Many of the books consist of dozens and dozens of separate xml files.  The books are not particularly mobile friendly.

For books for which we do not have the XML source, perhaps pandoc can be used to reconvert the HTML back to text markup.   We need to create a fully automated toolchain with the following features:   Source code stored on GitHub.  Commit hooks kick off an automated build (conversion to HTML5) and deployment of the books to their public location.  We need to determine where to host the books - (e.g. OI website, Github pages, readthedocs.com, etc.)  The docs maintenance process needs to be documented itself.
